# NLP-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Coursera Project May’21 - July’21
- To implement a Twitter sentiment analysis model that overcomes the challenges of identifying sentiments of tweets 
- Performed EDA to explore columns, length, shape, datatype, null values and plotted the word cloud for visualization 
- Created a pipeline to remove punctuations, stopwords and perform count vectorization using NLTK and scikit-learn 
- Trained Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier model on the testing data using scikit-learn to perform classification
- Assessed the performance of trained model on test dataset by using the confusion matrix and classification report
- The trained model was able to predict sentiment of tweets up to an accuracy of 95% and an F measure of 0.67
